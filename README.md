# bookshelf

This app is my sandbox for learning Express and Node. 

I am a book lover and have always wanted my own online bookshelf/repository. I've used Goodreads, but their shelving feature isn't exactly what I'm looking for.

As I continue to build out this app, I'll have it hosted on my own server with features added when I get time.

UPDATE: I have started a new instance of this app using React [here](https://github.com/danielahampton/react-bookshelf)

# Installation

Requirements:
* MongoDB
* Node > v4

Clone the repo into a local folder.

Run `npm install`

Start Mongo

Run `npm start`

You're good to go! App will be running on **localhost:3000**
